# po_indexer
Tool to index directories into searchable, self-contained offline html files.

Requires: Linux bash and Python 2.7

Simply add the "po_indexer" folder into the folder you wish to index and run ./po_indexer.sh
This will output a single index.html file in the root of the indexed folder (along-side the po_indexer folder).  

You can open this index.html file to search and browse your files. 

It does not require a web server and the file is completely portable - you can email it to someone to let browse it too!
If you browse the index.html from a network share it can directly open and play any media or files (if the browser supports them).

I wrote this script 6 years ago and was never quite done with it... But for the sake of getting it out there, here it is!  
I look forward on rewriting it and doing lots more and hopefully now that it's on github it'll be easier for me to do that.
